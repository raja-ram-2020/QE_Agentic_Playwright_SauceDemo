description: Copy-paste AI prompt templates for common Playwright framework development tasks — adding page objects, functional/E2E tests, factories, fixtures, and components. Use when the user asks "how do I add a ...", "give me a prompt for ...", "create a new [page object | test | factory | fixture | component]", or when bootstrapping a new framework artifact and wanting a standardized starting prompt. This skill is a routing layer; for the deep rules of each task category load the matching skill directly — page-objects / selectors / playwright-cli for UI locators, fixtures / helpers for fixtures, data-strategy for factories and static data, test-standards for test structure and tags, type-safety for TypeScript, enums for route/message enums.

# AI Prompt Templates for Agentic Playwright

Codegen sub-router. Owns prompt templates per artifact type and the post-generation verification checklist. Plugs into `ai-native-workflow` Phase 2 (Route) for codegen intents.

For the 8-phase workflow see `ai-native-workflow/SKILL.md`. For worked examples and troubleshooting see this skill's `references/`.

## Critical

These rules are unique to template usage. **All other rules** (selectors, waits, types, tags, fixtures, JSDoc, no-XPath, no-hardcoded-strings, etc.) live in the **`CLAUDE.md` Constitution** and the **leaf skills** (`page-objects`, `selectors`, `test-standards`, `data-strategy`, `type-safety`, `fixtures`, `enums`). Re-read the Constitution + the matching leaf skill's Critical block **before** generating from any template here.

- **Resolve `{area}` first.** Every template contains `{area}` as a placeholder. Run the matching `ls` (`ls pages/`, `ls tests/`, `ls test-data/factories/`, `ls test-data/static/`, `ls enums/`) and substitute the real folder name **before** filling the template. Do not guess.
- **Templates are starters, not substitutes.** Each template is a 10-15 line framework. The leaf skill listed for the category owns the deep rules — load it and follow it end-to-end. Never reimplement a leaf skill's rules inline in your prompt.
- **Walk the verification checklist** (below) after generating. It is the canonical post-codegen audit; the leaf skills point here for it.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Identify the task category and resolve paths

Match the user's request to one row, then run the `ls` commands the row's templates need.

| Category                | Template section                      | Specialized skill(s)                          | `ls` to run before filling                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Page object / component | Page Object Tasks                     | `page-objects`, `selectors`, `playwright-cli` | `ls pages/`                                          |
| Functional / E2E test   | Test Tasks                            | `test-standards`, `data-strategy`             | `ls tests/`, `ls test-data/factories/`               |
| Data factory            | Data Factory Tasks                    | `data-strategy`, `type-safety`                | `ls test-data/factories/`                            |
| Static test data        | Data Factory Tasks → Static Test Data | `data-strategy`                               | `ls test-data/static/`                               |
| Fixture (POM / helper)  | Fixture Tasks                         | `fixtures`, `helpers`                         | (no path placeholder)                                |
| UI component            | Component Tasks                       | `page-objects`, `selectors`                   | (no path placeholder)                                |

### Phase 2: Select and customize the matching prompt template

Open the theme file for your category from the [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates) index below, copy the block, and replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` and every `{area}` with concrete values. Leave no unreplaced placeholders in the final prompt.

### Phase 3: Load the specialized skill for the deep rules

The templates intentionally stay shallow. When the task needs more than the template's bullets — full status-code coverage, selector exploration rules, fixture composition patterns — load the specialized skill listed in Phase 1 and follow it end-to-end. **Do not reimplement that skill's rules inline.** Re-read the `CLAUDE.md` Constitution + the leaf skill's Critical block before writing code.

### Phase 4: Verify with the checklist, then run the affected tests

Walk every box. Then run the affected tests; on red, load `debugging`.

#### Verification Checklist

After generating code, confirm each box:

- [ ] Imports are from `fixtures/pom/test-options.ts` (never `@playwright/test` in specs)
- [ ] Routes, credentials, and URLs come from `process.env.*` and `enums/{area}/*` — nothing hardcoded
- [ ] Locators use `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByTestId` — no XPath
- [ ] No `any` types
- [ ] No hard waits (`waitForTimeout`)
- [ ] No JSDoc on locator getters/methods (JSDoc only on action methods)
- [ ] Tests use `test.step` with Given/When/Then structure
- [ ] Each test has exactly ONE tag from `@smoke`, `@sanity`, `@regression`, `@e2e`, `@destructive` (never `@functional`, never multiple)
- [ ] Tags live on individual tests, not on `test.describe()` blocks
- [ ] Tests that mutate **shared/global** state (locale, permissions, roles, guest access, feature flags, global settings) are tagged **only** `@destructive`; tests that create + clean up **only their own data** keep their importance tag
- [ ] **Any** state-mutating test (destructive or isolated) has an `afterEach`/`afterAll` hook that reverts what it wrote
- [ ] Happy-path test data uses factories; curated invalid values come from `test-data/static/util/` or `test-data/static/{area}/`
- [ ] No explore-only or throwaway test files committed

#### Run the affected tests (mandatory)

```bash
npx playwright test tests/{area}/[type]/[name].spec.ts   # specific file
npx playwright test --grep @smoke                        # by tag
npm test                                                 # all non-destructive
```

**Failure protocol:** Read the error → load `debugging` (failure-mode taxonomy + right Playwright tool per failure: UI Mode, Trace Viewer, Inspector, HTML report) → fix the root cause (no `try/catch` on `expect`, no timeout bumps, no silent `.skip`) → re-run; for flake fixes, 5x consecutively.

## Prompt Templates

Split by theme under `templates/` so the agent loads only the slice it needs — open the file matching your Phase 1 category, copy the block, and replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` and `{area}` with concrete values.

- [Page object templates](references/templates/page-objects.md) — new page object (with / without exploration), add locators, add action method
- [Test templates](references/templates/tests.md) — functional, E2E, and data-driven tests
- [Data templates](references/templates/data.md) — Faker factory and static test data
- [Fixture templates](references/templates/fixtures.md) — page-object fixture, helper fixture, fixture category
- [Component templates](references/templates/components.md) — reusable UI component
